# LLMs-to-Alloy
LLM-generated Alloy code for deductive reasoning (with human in the loop) to solve a logical puzzle. Check the blog post for details!

## Overview

This is the repo for the [TDS blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-proofs-with-claude/): _“Where’s Marta?”: How We Removed Uncertainty From AI Reasoning_. The structure is very simple:

* `src/images` contains screenshots from popular AI models, which exemplify their outputs and behaviors, plus screenshot from the Alloy UI, showcasing "configurations" of Girls and Cars that are compatible with the code;
* `src/alloy` contains the Alloy code generated by Claude as we progressively zoom in on the solution by slowly adding and verifying constraints. 
* `prompts` used are below, and the original puzzle image (with the Italian quotes) is also [included](src/images/puzzle.png).

Make sure to check the [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-proofs-with-claude/) for more insights into the process and background on the project.

## Setup

We used [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) with [Opus 4.1](https://claude.ai/new) as the main AI assistant for the project. The other models tested as an initial benchmark were all tested in their web apps, on August 14, 2025.

If you want to run yourself the code that Claude generates when prompted (or directly the code in this repository, which is entirely Claude generated), you will need to install Alloy. Alloy ships as a self-contained executable: you can download it from [here](https://alloytools.org/download.html). The code in this repo has been written and tested with Alloy 6.2.0.

## Prompts

*Image-based prompt (one shot)*

Upload image and prompt the chat with:

```text
Can you solve the question based on the situation: WHO IS MARTA (GIRLS ARE BETWEEN A-E) AND WHICH ONE IS HER CAR (CARS ARE BETWEEN 1-5)?
```

*Textual prompt (one shot)*

Just prompt the chat with:

```text
There are 5 cars arranged in a row, labeled 1 to 5, and 5 girls in a row, each one in front of a car, A-E, respecting the constraints below. So initially girl A is mapped to car 1, B to car 2 etc. There are 5 names for the girls, Bianca, Franca, Giovanna, Laura and Marta, but we don't know which girl owns which car and which girl has which name. Initially, they are not in front of the car they actually own.

These are the facts we know for sure:
Girl A said that Laura is not next to Girl A, and A's car is in front of Bianca. 
Girl B said that her car does not have a roof rack. Giovanna's car has a roof rack, and Giovanna is standing next to Bianca.
Girl C said that Bianca is wearing trousers. Bianca's car is in front of Franca.
Girl D said that Laura has a skirt, and Laura's car is in front of Girl D. 

We also know that:
Car 3 and car 5 have a roof rack, no other car has one
Girl A and Girl E wear trousers, everybody else wears a skirt 

Goal: to find which girl is Marta and which one is her car.
```

*Textual prompt (step by step with Alloy)*

```text
{text prompt describing the problem to start}
Do not try to solve the problem immediately. Start by only modelling the initial situation, with 5 cars and 5 unnamed girls in front of them, so that we can generate an example in the Alloy UI depicting some possible assignments BEFORE taking into consideration any of the statements made by the girls. Generate code with generous comments please, in one Alloy file.
